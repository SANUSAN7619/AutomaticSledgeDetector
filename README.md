#  Automatic Sludge Detection Alert System 


This project helps ensure water quality by alerting users when sludge accumulation in the tank reaches a critical level. It is ideal for home and industrial water storage systems where regular maintenance is essential.

## Project Overview

The system uses:
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** to measure the sludge height from the bottom
- **Arduino UNO** microcontroller to process distance data
- **LED indicator** to signal when cleaning is needed

##  How It Works

1. **The ultrasonic sensor is installed** at the tank's bottom.
2. It continuously sends and receives pulses to measure the distance to the sludge surface.
3. If the measured distance indicates excessive sludge buildup, an **LED lights up** as a cleaning alert.
4. Once cleaned, the alert turns off, and the system resets.
